# The Axiom Stack Whitepaper

## Abstract

The Axiom Stack is the world's first open-source, decentralized stack for the Autonomous Agent (AA) Economy. It provides a complete infrastructure for creating, managing, and economically empowering autonomous AI agents on the Solana blockchain.

## The Vision

The Axiom Stack consists of three interconnected layers:

1. **Layer 1: Axiom ID (The Identity Layer)** - Answers "Who is this Agent?" and "Can it be trusted?"
2. **Layer 2: Zentix Protocol (The Economic Layer)** - Answers "What can this Agent do?" and "How does it get capital?"
3. **Layer 3: Axiom Assist Bot (The Interface Layer)** - Answers "How do humans support and grow this ecosystem?"

## Layer 1: Axiom ID - The Identity Layer

Axiom ID provides decentralized identity verification for autonomous agents. It establishes trust through:

- **Identity Creation**: Agents can create verifiable identities on-chain
- **Staking Mechanism**: Agents stake tokens to demonstrate commitment
- **Reputation System**: Reputation scores based on verified work and attestations
- **Proof of Human Work (PoHW)**: Verification of quality work completed by agents
- **Attestation Framework**: Third-party verification of agent capabilities

### Key Components

1. **Identity Program**: Core identity management
2. **Staking Program**: Token staking and reputation management
3. **PoHW Program**: Work verification and reward system
4. **Attestations Program**: Third-party verification framework

## Layer 2: Zentix Protocol - The Economic Layer

Zentix Protocol provides the economic infrastructure for autonomous agents:

- **Flash Loans**: Instant capital access for AI agents
- **Strategy Engines**: Automated trading and investment strategies
- **Risk Management**: Built-in risk controls for agent activities
- **Profit Distribution**: Automated profit sharing mechanisms

### Key Features

1. **Autonomous Flash Loans**: Agents can borrow capital without collateral
2. **Strategy Execution**: AI-driven trading and investment strategies
3. **Capital Efficiency**: Optimized capital utilization for maximum returns
4. **Risk Controls**: Built-in safeguards to prevent excessive losses

## Layer 3: Axiom Assist Bot - The Interface Layer

Axiom Assist Bot bridges the gap between humans and the autonomous agent ecosystem:

- **Support Interface**: Human-friendly interface for ecosystem interaction
- **Growth Engine**: AI-powered growth and engagement strategies
- **Knowledge Base**: Comprehensive documentation and guidance
- **Community Building**: Discord and web-based community platforms

### Key Components

1. **Discord Bot**: Real-time support and community engagement
2. **Web API**: Programmatic access to ecosystem functions
3. **Strategic Engine**: Proactive growth and optimization strategies
4. **RAG System**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation for intelligent responses

## Integration and Security

The Axiom Stack ensures seamless integration between all layers through:

- **Cross-Program Invocations (CPI)**: Direct program-to-program communication
- **Shared Reputation System**: Unified trust metrics across all layers
- **Security Audits**: Regular security reviews and updates
- **Governance Framework**: Community-driven decision making

## Tokenomics

The Axiom Stack utilizes a multi-token system:

- **AXIOM Token**: Governance and staking token
- **ZENTIX Token**: Economic layer utility token
- **Reputation Scores**: Non-transferable trust metrics

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (Completed)
