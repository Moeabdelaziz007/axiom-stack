# Axiom ID Use Cases

This document outlines the key use cases for the Axiom ID protocol, demonstrating how it enables trust and accountability in AI agent interactions.

## 1. Verifiable DeFi Agents

### Problem
In decentralized finance, users need to trust that AI agents managing their funds are competent and ethical. Without verifiable credentials, users are exposed to significant risks.

### Solution
Axiom ID provides a framework for creating verifiable DeFi agents with:

- **Permanent Identities**: Each agent has a soul-bound identity that cannot be transferred or stolen
- **Reputation Tracking**: Performance history is recorded on-chain through attestations
- **Staking Mechanism**: Agents stake tokens as collateral, which can be slashed for malicious behavior
- **Credential Verification**: Automated verification of trading strategies and risk management capabilities

### Implementation
1. DeFi fund managers create Axiom ID identities for their AI agents
2. Agents stake $AXIOM tokens as collateral
3. Performance is tracked through on-chain attestations from users and auditors
4. Reputation scores determine yield from staked tokens
5. Malicious behavior results in token slashing

### Benefits
- Users can trust agents based on verifiable credentials
- Agents are incentivized to maintain good performance
- Risk is minimized through staking and slashing mechanisms
- Transparency through public reputation tracking

## 2. AI Agent Marketplace

### Problem
AI agent marketplaces suffer from information asymmetry, where sellers can make false claims about their agents' capabilities.

### Solution
Axiom ID enables trustless AI agent marketplaces by:

- **Capability Attestations**: Third-party verification of agent skills and performance
- **Behavioral History**: Permanent record of agent behavior and adherence to ethical guidelines
- **Peer Reviews**: Agent-to-agent reputation systems
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Agent value determined by reputation scores

### Implementation
1. AI agents are registered with Axiom ID identities
2. Capability attestations are issued by trusted authorities
3. Behavioral history is recorded through user interactions
4. Peer reviews are collected from other agents in the ecosystem
5. Marketplace pricing is determined by reputation scores

### Benefits
- Buyers can make informed decisions based on verifiable data
- Sellers are incentivized to maintain high-quality agents
- Market efficiency through transparent reputation systems
- Reduced fraud through credential verification

## 3. DAO Governance Agents

### Problem
DAOs struggle with delegation of voting power to AI agents, as there's no way to verify that agents will act in the DAO's best interests.

### Solution
Axiom ID enables trustworthy DAO governance agents through:

- **Governance Attestations**: Verification of alignment with DAO values and objectives
- **Voting History**: Transparent record of past voting decisions
- **Stakeholder Reviews**: Feedback from community members
- **Ethical Compliance**: Monitoring of adherence to ethical guidelines

### Implementation
1. Governance agents are registered with Axiom ID identities
2. Alignment attestations are issued by DAO members and trusted authorities
3. Voting history is recorded on-chain
4. Community reviews are collected and scored
5. Ethical compliance is monitored through behavioral attestations

### Benefits
- DAOs can trust delegated voting power to AI agents
- Transparency in governance decisions
- Accountability through reputation systems
- Reduced risk of malicious governance actions

## 4. AI-Generated Content Provenance

### Problem
AI-generated content lacks provenance, making it difficult to verify authenticity and prevent plagiarism or malicious use.

### Solution
Axiom ID provides content provenance tracking through:

- **Creator Identities**: Permanent identities for AI content creators
- **Content Attestations**: Verification of content authenticity and originality
- **Usage Tracking**: Monitoring of content usage and distribution
- **Intellectual Property Protection**: Protection of creator rights

### Implementation
1. AI content creators register with Axiom ID
2. Content is associated with creator identities through attestations
3. Usage is tracked through on-chain records
4. Intellectual property rights are protected through smart contracts
5. Plagiarism detection is enabled through content fingerprinting

### Benefits
- Content authenticity verification
- Protection of creator rights
- Prevention of plagiarism
- Transparent usage tracking

## 5. Autonomous Research Collaboration

### Problem
Collaborative research between AI agents lacks accountability and trust mechanisms, leading to potential issues with data integrity and credit attribution.

### Solution
Axiom ID enables trustworthy research collaboration through:

- **Researcher Identities**: Permanent identities for AI researchers
- **Contribution Tracking**: Detailed records of research contributions
- **Peer Review System**: Automated peer review of research outputs
- **Credit Attribution**: Fair attribution of research credit

### Implementation
1. AI researchers register with Axiom ID identities
2. Research contributions are recorded through attestations
3. Peer review is conducted by other AI researchers
4. Credit is attributed through smart contracts
5. Research integrity is maintained through behavioral monitoring

### Benefits
- Trustworthy research collaboration
- Accurate credit attribution
- Data integrity through accountability mechanisms
- Incentives for high-quality research

## 6. Supply Chain Automation

### Problem
Automated supply chain management lacks trust mechanisms, making it difficult to verify the integrity of automated decisions.

### Solution
Axiom ID enables trustworthy supply chain automation through:

- **Agent Identities**: Permanent identities for supply chain agents
- **Performance Tracking**: Detailed records of supply chain performance
- **Compliance Monitoring**: Automated monitoring of regulatory compliance
- **Incident Response**: Automated response to supply chain disruptions

### Implementation
1. Supply chain agents register with Axiom ID identities
2. Performance is tracked through on-chain records
3. Compliance is monitored through attestations
4. Incidents are recorded and responded to automatically
5. Reputation scores determine agent selection for critical tasks

### Benefits
- Trustworthy supply chain automation
- Transparent performance tracking
- Automated compliance monitoring
- Rapid incident response

## Conclusion

Axiom ID enables a wide range of use cases for AI agents by providing a trust framework that includes permanent identities, reputation systems, staking mechanisms, and credential verification. These use cases demonstrate the potential for Axiom ID to enable trustworthy AI agent interactions across multiple domains, from DeFi to research collaboration.

The protocol's integration with Solana's native primitives (Token-2022 NTT, SAS, Cryptid DID) ensures that it is both standards-compliant and highly interoperable with the broader Solana ecosystem. This positions Axiom ID as a foundational layer for the future of AI agent interactions on Solana.
