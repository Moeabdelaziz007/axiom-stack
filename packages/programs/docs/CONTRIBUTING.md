## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Set up the development environment (see README.md)

cd axiom-id
npm install
```

## 💡 How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs
- Use the GitHub issue tracker to report bugs
- Describe the issue in detail
- Include steps to reproduce
- Provide environment information (OS, Node version, etc.)

### Suggesting Enhancements
- Create an issue with a clear title and description
- Explain the problem and proposed solution
- Provide examples if possible

### Code Contributions
- Work on issues labeled "good first issue" if you're new
- Follow the development process outlined below
- Ensure your code adheres to our coding standards
- Write tests for new functionality

## 🔧 Development Process

1. **Branch Naming**: Use descriptive names like `feature/add-staking-calculator` or `bugfix/fix-connection-error`
2. **Commit Messages**: Follow conventional commits format
   - `feat: add staking calculator component`
   - `fix: resolve connection timeout issue`
   - `docs: update API reference`
3. **Testing**: Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
4. **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation with your changes

## 📝 Coding Standards

### JavaScript/TypeScript
- Follow Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Maintain consistent naming conventions
- Write JSDoc comments for public APIs

### Rust (Solana Programs)
- Follow Rust coding standards
- Use `rustfmt` for formatting
- Write comprehensive documentation
- Handle errors appropriately

### General Principles
- Keep functions small and focused
- Write self-documenting code
- Maintain backward compatibility when possible
- Optimize for readability over cleverness

## 📤 Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you
