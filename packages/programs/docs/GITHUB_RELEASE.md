# Axiom ID v1.0.0: Decentralized Identity Layer for AI Agents

## 🎉 First Open Source Release

We're excited to announce the first open-source release of **Axiom ID**, a decentralized identity protocol that provides verifiable identities for AI agents, enabling trust-based interactions in autonomous agent networks.

This release marks a pivotal moment in our journey to establish Axiom ID as the foundational trust layer for AI agent ecosystems. By making our core protocols and SDKs openly available, we aim to:

1. Build trust through transparent, auditable code
2. Accelerate adoption by removing barriers to entry
3. Establish industry standards for AI agent identity
4. Create network effects through community contributions

## 🚀 Key Features

### Core Identity Protocol
- On-chain identity management for AI agents
- Non-Transferable Tokens (NTTs) for persistent agent identities
- Self-sovereign identity with Cryptid DID integration

### Reputation System
- Proof of Human Work (PoHW) based reputation scoring
- Behavioral analysis for fraud detection
- Dynamic trust verification mechanisms

### Staking & Economics
- Reputation-based staking with dynamic APY
- Cross-program reward distribution
- Community governance mechanisms

### Integration Capabilities
- **Google ADK**: Seamlessly integrate AI agents with Google Assistant
- **Telegram Mini Apps**: Deploy agents as interactive chat experiences
- **Cross-Agent Payments**: Enable secure A2A transactions with x402 standard

## 🔧 Technical Components

### Solana Programs
- **Axiom ID Program**: Core identity management on-chain
- **Axiom Staking Program**: Reputation-based staking mechanisms
- **Axiom Attestations Program**: Credential verification and trust scoring
- **Axiom Governance Program**: Community-driven protocol governance
- **Axiom Token Program**: SPL Token integration for staking rewards
- **Axiom PoHW Program**: Proof of Human Work validation
- **Axiom Dynamic Staking Program**: Advanced staking with reputation multipliers

### SDK Features
- Agent identity creation and management
- Reputation score calculation and retrieval
- Credential presentation and verification
- Token staking with dynamic APY
- Fraud detection and behavioral analysis
- Batch verification for performance optimization

## 📦 Getting Started

### Installation
```bash
npm install @axiom-id/sdk
```

### Quick Example
```javascript
import { AxiomIDClient } from '@axiom-id/sdk';

// Initialize client
const client = new AxiomIDClient();

// Connect to Solana
await client.connect(wallet);

// Create agent identity
const identity = await client.createAgentIdentity(keypair, 'Helpful Assistant');

// Get reputation score
const reputation = await client.getReputationScore(publicKey);
```
