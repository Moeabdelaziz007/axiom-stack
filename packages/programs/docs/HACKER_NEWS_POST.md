# Show HN: Axiom ID – Open-Source "Trust Layer" for Google's ADK using Solana

**Title**: Show HN: We built an open-source "Trust Layer" for Google's ADK using Solana

**Post Content**:

After months of development, I'm excited to share Axiom ID – an open-source protocol that provides verifiable identities for AI agents, enabling trust-based interactions in autonomous agent networks.

## The Problem

Google's Assistant Development Kit (ADK) and other AI agent platforms lack a fundamental component: a trust layer. How can you verify an AI agent's reputation? How can you ensure it hasn't been compromised? How can agents build trust with users and other agents?

## The Solution

Axiom ID provides a decentralized identity layer where every AI agent has a verifiable on-chain identity, reputation score, and credentials. Think of it as "Google ADK meets Web3 identity."

## Key Features

- **Agent Identity**: On-chain identities for AI agents with Non-Transferable Tokens (NTTs)
- **Reputation System**: Proof of Human Work (PoHW) based reputation scoring
- **Credential Verification**: Trusted credential presentation and verification
- **Dynamic Staking**: Reputation-based staking with dynamic APY
- **Fraud Detection**: Behavioral analysis for anomaly detection
- **Cross-Agent Payments**: Secure A2A transactions with x402 standard
- **Google ADK Integration**: Seamless integration with Google Assistant

## Quick Demo

*Giving your Google ADK Agent a verifiable identity in under 2 minutes*

## Why This Matters

As AI agents become more autonomous and capable, trust becomes paramount. Axiom ID provides the foundation for a trust-based economy of AI agents, where reputation is earned through Proof of Human Work and maintained through cryptographic verification.

## Technical Details

Built on Solana for speed and low-cost transactions, Axiom ID includes:
- 7 Solana programs for identity, staking, attestations, and governance
- TypeScript SDK for easy integration
- Google ADK integration examples
- Telegram Mini App integration
- Comprehensive documentation and whitepaper

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/axiom-id.git
cd axiom-id
npm install
npm run demo
```

The demo shows creating an agent identity, getting reputation scores, presenting credentials, and staking tokens – all in under 2 minutes.

## Why Open Source?

A trust layer for AI agents must be transparent and community-driven. By making Axiom ID open source (Apache 2.0), we're building a standard that anyone can adopt, extend, and improve.

## Future Plans

- Integration with other AI agent frameworks (LangChain, AutoGPT)
- Multi-chain support (Ethereum, Polygon)
- Mobile wallet for agent identity management
- Native governance token with DAO

I'm looking for feedback from the HN community on:
1. Is this solving a real problem you've encountered?
2. What additional features would make this more useful for your projects?
3. Would you be interested in contributing to the open-source project?

Thanks for your time and feedback!

**Comments Strategy**:

After posting, I'll actively engage with comments by:
1. Answering technical questions about the implementation
2. Sharing insights about the design decisions
3. Inviting developers to try the demo
4. Encouraging contributions and feedback# Show HN: Axiom ID – Open-Source "Trust Layer" for Google's ADK using Solana
