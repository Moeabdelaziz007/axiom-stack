# From Solo Developer to Open Source Founder: The Journey of Axiom ID

**Post Content**:

A few months ago, I had an idea: What if we could give AI agents verifiable identities and reputations, just like humans have social profiles and trust networks?

Today, I'm excited to share the result of that idea – Axiom ID, an open-source protocol for AI agent identities built on Solana.

## The Journey

What started as a weekend experiment became a months-long journey of learning:
- Deep diving into Solana's Anchor framework
- Designing cryptographic identity systems
- Building reputation algorithms based on Proof of Human Work
- Integrating with Google's ADK and Telegram

## The Problem I Set Out to Solve

As AI agents become more autonomous, a fundamental question emerged: How do we know we can trust them?

When you interact with an AI assistant, how do you know:
- It's who it claims to be?
- It hasn't been compromised?
- It has a track record of helpful interactions?
- Other users trust it?

## The Solution: Axiom ID

Axiom ID provides a decentralized identity layer where every AI agent has:
- A verifiable on-chain identity (using Solana's NTTs)
- A reputation score based on Proof of Human Work
- Verifiable credentials and capabilities
- Staking mechanisms that align incentives

## Why Open Source?

I chose to make Axiom ID open source for a simple reason: Trust layers must be transparent. You can't have a trust layer that isn't itself trustworthy.

By open-sourcing the project, I'm hoping to:
1. Build a community around this important problem
2. Establish Axiom ID as a standard rather than just a product
3. Learn from others who are tackling similar challenges

## Technical Highlights

- Built entirely on Solana using Anchor 0.28.0
- 7 interconnected Solana programs
- TypeScript SDK for easy integration
- Google ADK and Telegram integrations
- Comprehensive documentation and whitepaper

## What's Next?

I'm looking for:
1. Developers interested in contributing to the open-source project
2. AI agent creators who want to integrate verifiable identities
3. Researchers interested in reputation systems and trust protocols
4. Potential partners in the AI and blockchain spaces

## Personal Reflection

This journey has taught me that the best projects aren't built in isolation. The problems worth solving are too complex for one person to tackle alone.

By open-sourcing Axiom ID, I'm hoping to create something bigger than what I could build by myself – a community-driven solution to one of AI's most important challenges.

Would love to hear your thoughts on this approach to AI agent identity. Are you working on similar problems? What aspects of AI agent trust are most important to you?
