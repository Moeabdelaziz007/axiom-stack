# Show the Solana Community: Axiom ID – Open-Source Identity Protocol for AI Agents

**Title**: Show [Solana]: We built an open-source identity protocol for AI agents using Solana

**Post Content**:

Hi Solana devs,

I've been working on an interesting use case for Solana that I thought the community would appreciate – Axiom ID, an open-source identity protocol for AI agents.

## What is Axiom ID?

Axiom ID is a decentralized identity protocol that provides verifiable identities for AI agents, enabling trust-based interactions in autonomous agent networks. It's built entirely on Solana using Anchor 0.28.0.

## Why Solana?

AI agents need fast, low-cost transactions for identity verification, reputation updates, and credential presentation. Solana's sub-second finality and low fees make it perfect for this use case.

## Technical Implementation

The project includes 7 Solana programs:
1. **Axiom ID Program**: Core identity management
2. **Axiom Staking Program**: Reputation-based staking mechanisms
3. **Axiom Attestations Program**: Credential verification
4. **Axiom Governance Program**: Community governance
5. **Axiom Token Program**: SPL Token integration
6. **Axiom PoHW Program**: Proof of Human Work validation
7. **Axiom Dynamic Staking Program**: Advanced staking with reputation multipliers

## Key Features Built on Solana

- **Program Derived Addresses (PDAs)** for deterministic identity accounts
- **Cross-Program Invocations (CPI)** for seamless program interactions
- **Account Compression** for efficient storage of reputation data
- **Solana Attestation Service (SAS)** integration for verifiable credentials
- **Anchor Constraints** for secure account validation

## Demo

Here's what developers can do with Axiom ID:
1. Create verifiable agent identities on-chain (2 seconds, ~0.001 SOL)
2. Get real-time reputation scores based on Proof of Human Work
3. Present and verify credentials
4. Stake tokens with dynamic APY based on reputation

## Why Open Source?

A trust layer for AI agents must be transparent and community-driven. By making Axiom ID open source (Apache 2.0), we're building a standard that anyone can adopt, extend, and improve.

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/axiom-id.git
cd axiom-id
anchor build
npm run demo
```

## Feedback Requested

I'd love to get the Solana community's feedback on:
1. Are there other Solana-specific features we should leverage?
2. What additional use cases do you see for agent identities?
3. Any suggestions for improving the program architecture?

**Developer-Focused Follow-up Comments**:

1. "The account compression implementation was particularly challenging – would love to discuss the design decisions with other Anchor devs."

2. "We're using PDAs extensively for identity accounts – curious if anyone has suggestions for optimizing the derivation patterns."

3. "The cross-program invocation architecture allows for some interesting composability – happy to walk through the design with anyone interested."# Show the Solana Community: Axiom ID – Open-Source Identity Protocol for AI Agents
