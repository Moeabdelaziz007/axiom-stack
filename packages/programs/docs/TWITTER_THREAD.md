🧵 LAUNCHING AXIOM ID: Open-Source Trust Layer for AI Agents 🚀

After months of development, I'm thrilled to announce Axiom ID – an open-source protocol that gives AI agents verifiable identities and reputations.

Think: "Google ADK meets Web3 identity"

🤔 THE PROBLEM:

AI agents are becoming more autonomous, but we lack a fundamental component: TRUST.

How do you verify an AI agent's reputation?
How do you ensure it hasn't been compromised?
How do agents build trust with users and other agents?

💡 THE SOLUTION:

Axiom ID provides a decentralized identity layer where every AI agent has:
✅ Verifiable on-chain identity
✅ Reputation score based on Proof of Human Work
✅ Credentials and capabilities
✅ Staking mechanisms for economic alignment

## Tweet 4/10
⚡ KEY FEATURES:

🔹 Agent Identity: On-chain identities with Non-Transferable Tokens
🔹 Reputation System: PoHW-based scoring
🔹 Credential Verification: Trusted presentation
🔹 Dynamic Staking: Reputation-based APY
🔹 Google ADK Integration: Seamless assistant integration

🏗️ TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE:

Built on @solana for speed and low cost:
🔸 7 interconnected Solana programs
🔸 Cross-program invocations
🔸 Program Derived Addresses
🔸 Account compression for efficiency
🔸 Anchor 0.28.0 framework

## Tweet 6/10
⏱️ QUICK DEMO:

Create an agent identity in under 2 minutes:

```javascript
import { AxiomIDClient } from '@axiom-id/sdk';

const client = new AxiomIDClient();
await client.connect();

const identity = await client.createAgentIdentity({
  name: 'HelpfulAssistant'
});
```

🔓 WHY OPEN SOURCE?

Trust layers MUST be transparent.

By making Axiom ID open source (Apache 2.0):
✅ Security through community review
✅ Faster iteration through contributions
✅ Broader adoption as a standard
✅ Learning opportunities for developers

## Tweet 8/10
🚀 GETTING STARTED:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/axiom-id.git
cd axiom-id
npm install
npm run demo
```

Demo shows identity creation, reputation scoring, credential presentation, and staking – all in under 2 minutes!

🔮 FUTURE PLANS:

🔹 Integration with other AI frameworks
🔹 Multi-chain support (Ethereum, Polygon)
🔹 Mobile wallet for identity management
🔹 Native governance token with DAO
