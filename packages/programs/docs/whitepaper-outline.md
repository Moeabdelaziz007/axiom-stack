# Axiom ID Whitepaper Outline

## Executive Summary
- Brief overview of the problem: Trust gap in AI agent ecosystems
- Axiom ID solution: Decentralized identity and trust layer for autonomous agents
- Key benefits: Security, interoperability, and scalability

## Section A-1: Problem Identification - The Trust Gap in Google ADK
### The Promise of Google ADK
- Overview of Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK)
- Capabilities for creating autonomous AI agents
- Potential for agent-to-agent commerce and collaboration

### The Missing Piece: Trust Infrastructure
- Current limitations in ADK regarding identity verification
- Lack of on-chain reputation systems
- Absence of self-sovereign identity for agents
- Security vulnerabilities in agent interactions

### The Consequences
- Limited adoption of autonomous agent ecosystems
- Trust barriers preventing agent-to-agent transactions
- Difficulty in establishing accountability and provenance

## Section A-2: Axiom ID Solution - Decentralized Identity & Trust Layer
### Core Value Proposition
- Decentralized identity for autonomous agents
- On-chain reputation system based on verifiable credentials
- Trustless agent-to-agent commerce capabilities

### Key Components
1. **Agent Identity System**
   - Non-transferable soul-bound tokens (NTTs) for agent identities
   - Integration with Cryptid DID for programmable identities
   - Metadata association for agent personas and capabilities

2. **Reputation-as-Yield (RaY) Mechanism**
   - Staking contracts with dynamic APY based on SAS attestations
   - Slashing protocols for malicious behavior
   - Yield distribution based on reputation scores

3. **Verifiable Credential Framework**
   - Integration with Solana Attestation Service (SAS)
   - Credential verification system for agent interactions
   - Reputation history tracking and portability

## Section A-3: Technical Architecture
### System Overview
- High-level architecture diagram
- Interaction between components
- Data flow and trust relationships

### Core Smart Contracts
1. **Agent-Soul Factory**
   - Token-2022 NTT-based identity creation
   - Integration with Cryptid DID for programmable identities
   - Soul-bound token minting and management

2. **Staking and Reputation Contracts**
   - $AXIOM token staking mechanism
   - Dynamic yield calculation based on reputation
   - Integration with Solana Attestation Service (SAS)

3. **Security Framework**
   - Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)
   - Programmatic wallet integration
   - Key rotation mechanisms

### Integration Points
- Google ADK integration layer
- Solana blockchain connectivity
- Cross-program interactions

## Section A-4: Use Cases for Axiom ID & ADK Integration
### Trust in Action: Real-World Use Cases

1. **Secure Agent-to-Agent Transactions**
   - Value transfer between autonomous agents
   - Smart contract execution with verified counterparties
   - Dispute resolution mechanisms

2. **Provenance Tracking for AI-Generated Content**
   - Attribution of AI-generated content to specific agents
   - Verification of content authenticity
   - Intellectual property protection

3. **Reputation-Based Task Assignment**
   - Matching tasks to agents based on verified capabilities
   - Quality assurance through reputation scores
   - Performance-based reward distribution

### Integration Benefits
- Enhanced security for agent interactions
- Improved trust in AI-generated outputs
- Streamlined collaboration between agents
