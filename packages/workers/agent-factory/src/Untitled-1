### Claude Code (via Plugin Marketplace)
In Claude Code, register the marketplace first:

```
/plugin marketplace add obra/superpowers-marketplace
```

Then install the plugin from this marketplace:

```
/plugin install superpowers@superpowers-marketplace
```

### Verify Installation
Check that commands appear:

```
/help
```


```
# Should see: # /superpowers:brainstorm - Interactive design refinement # /superpowers:write-plan - Create implementation plan # /superpowers:execute-plan - Execute plan in batches
```


```
# Should see: # /superpowers:brainstorm - Interactive design refinement # /superpowers:write-plan - Create implementation plan # /superpowers:execute-plan - Execute plan in batches
```

### Codex (Experimental)
Note: Codex support is experimental and may require refinement based on user feedback.
Tell Codex to fetch [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/obra/superpowers/refs/heads/main/.codex/INSTALL.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/obra/superpowers/refs/heads/main/.codex/INSTALL.md) and follow the instructions.

### Using Slash Commands
Brainstorm a design:

```
/superpowers:brainstorm
```


```
/superpowers:brainstorm
```

Create an implementation plan:

```
/superpowers:write-plan
```


```
/superpowers:write-plan
```

Execute the plan:

```
/superpowers:execute-plan
```


```
/superpowers:execute-plan
```

### Automatic Skill Activation
Skills activate automatically when relevant. For example:
- test-driven-development activates when implementing features
- systematic-debugging activates when debugging issues
- verification-before-completion activates before claiming work is done

```
test-driven-development
```


```
systematic-debugging
```


```
verification-before-completion
```

### Skills Library
Testing (skills/testing/)

```
skills/testing/
```

- test-driven-development - RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle
- condition-based-waiting - Async test patterns
- testing-anti-patterns - Common pitfalls to avoid
Debugging (skills/debugging/)

```
skills/debugging/
```

- systematic-debugging - 4-phase root cause process
- root-cause-tracing - Find the real problem
- verification-before-completion - Ensure it's actually fixed
- defense-in-depth - Multiple validation layers
Collaboration (skills/collaboration/)

```
skills/collaboration/
```

- brainstorming - Socratic design refinement
- writing-plans - Detailed implementation plans
- executing-plans - Batch execution with checkpoints
- dispatching-parallel-agents - Concurrent subagent workflows
- requesting-code-review - Pre-review checklist
- receiving-code-review - Responding to feedback
- using-git-worktrees - Parallel development branches
- finishing-a-development-branch - Merge/PR decision workflow
- subagent-driven-development - Fast iteration with quality gates
Meta (skills/meta/)

```
skills/meta/
```

- writing-skills - Create new skills following best practices
- sharing-skills - Contribute skills back via branch and PR
- testing-skills-with-subagents - Validate skill quality
- using-superpowers - Introduction to the skills system

### Commands
All commands are thin wrappers that activate the corresponding skill:
- brainstorm.md - Activates the brainstorming skill
- write-plan.md - Activates the writing-plans skill
- execute-plan.md - Activates the executing-plans skill

```
brainstorming
```


```
writing-plans
```


```
executing-plans
```

## How It Works
1. SessionStart Hook - Loads the using-superpowers skill at session start
2. Skills System - Uses Claude Code's first-party skills system
3. Automatic Discovery - Claude finds and uses relevant skills for your task
4. Mandatory Workflows - When a skill exists for your task, using it becomes required

```
using-superpowers
```

## Philosophy
- Test-Driven Development - Write tests first, always
- Systematic over ad-hoc - Process over guessing
- Complexity reduction - Simplicity as primary goal
- Evidence over claims - Verify before declaring success
- Domain over implementation - Work at problem level, not solution level
